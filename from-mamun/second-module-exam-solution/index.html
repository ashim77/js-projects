    1. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array and returns the minimum number of this array using a loop. Ignore the built-in method for finding.

    Example:
    Input: const numbers = ["10", "21", 3, "14", "53", 55, ”36”, 48];
    Output: 3

    2. Create a JavaScript function that generates a random password with a specified length. The password should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

    Character Set :
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%
    ^&*()"

    Example:
    Input: generateRandomPassword(8);
    Output: “Pas@word”

    3. Write a Javascript function that takes 2 arrays as input. Which are productList and availableProductInInventory. Your task is to determine which products are in stock and which are out of stock.

    Example
    Input:
    const productList = [
        {id: 101, title: "Product 1"},
        {id: 102, title: "Product 2"},
        {id: 103, title: "Product 3"},
        {id: 104, title: "Product 4"}
    ];
    const availableProductInInventory = [102, 104];

    Output:
    {
        inStockProductList: [{id: 102, title: "Product 2"}, {id: 104, title: "Product 4"}],
        outOfStockProductList: [{id: 101, title: "Product 1"}, {id: 105, title: "Product 3"}]
    }

    4. How do you add or remove properties from an object dynamically two operations are managed from one function?


    5. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with only the even numbers.

    Example:
    Input: const numbers = [10, 21, 3, 14, 53, 55, 36, 48]
    Output: [10, 14, 36, 48]

    6. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of objects and a key, and returns a new array sorted based on the values of that key in ascending order.

    Example:
    Input const people = [
        { name: "John", age: 30 },
        { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
        { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
    ];
    const data = myfunction(people, "age");
    [
        { name: "Alice", age: 25},
        { name: "John", age: 30 },
        { name: "Bob", age: 35 },
    ]

    7. Write a JavaScript function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.

    Example:
    const arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7];
    const arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8];
    myfunction(arr1, arr2);

    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    8. Write a JavaScript class definition for the Product class with a constructor and the getTotalPrice() method. Additionally, create an instance of the Product class and calculate its total price (price multiplied by quantity).

    Assume the following product data:
    Product Name: "Laptop"
    Price: 1000
    Quantity: 3
